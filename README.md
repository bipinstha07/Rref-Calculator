A Reduced Row Echelon Form (RREF) calculator is a tool that performs row operations on a matrix to convert it into its reduced row echelon form. 
This form is a standardized way of representing linear systems of equations, making it easier to solve them and understand their properties.

Reduced Row Echelon Form (RREF) is a specific form of a matrix that is often used in linear algebra to simplify systems of linear equations. It is a more refined version of Row Echelon Form (REF). A matrix is in RREF if it satisfies the following conditions:

Properties of RREF

--Leading 1s: Each non-zero row has a leading 1, which is the first non-zero entry in that row.

--Zero Rows: Any rows that consist entirely of zeros are at the bottom of the matrix.

--Column of Leading 1s: The leading 1 in any row is the only non-zero entry in its column.

--Order of Leading 1s: The leading 1 of a row is to the right of the leading 1 of the previous row (if applicable).

Features of an RREF Calculator

--Input Matrix: You can input a matrix of coefficients for a system of linear equations. The matrix can be of any size (m x n).


  --Row Operations: The calculator typically applies three types of elementary row operations:


  --Swap: Interchanging two rows.

  --Multiply: Multiplying a row by a non-zero scalar.

  --Add: Adding or subtracting a multiple of one row from another row.

  --Output: The calculator provides the matrix in reduced row echelon form, which has the following characteristics:
