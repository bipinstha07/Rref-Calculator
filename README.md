A Reduced Row Echelon Form (RREF) calculator is a tool that performs row operations on a matrix to convert it into its reduced row echelon form. 
This form is a standardized way of representing linear systems of equations, making it easier to solve them and understand their properties.


Features of an RREF Calculator

Input Matrix: You can input a matrix of coefficients for a system of linear equations. The matrix can be of any size (m x n).


  Row Operations: The calculator typically applies three types of elementary row operations:


  Swap: Interchanging two rows.

  Multiply: Multiplying a row by a non-zero scalar.

  Add: Adding or subtracting a multiple of one row from another row.

  Output: The calculator provides the matrix in reduced row echelon form, which has the following characteristics:



Each leading entry (first non-zero number from the left, also called a pivot) of a non-zero row is 1.
Each leading 1 is the only non-zero entry in its column.
The leading 1 in each row is to the right of the leading 1 in the previous row.
Any rows consisting entirely of zeros are at the bottom of the matrix.
Solution Interpretation: If the RREF corresponds to a system of linear equations, the calculator may also provide solutions (if they exist) or indicate if the system is inconsistent or dependent.
